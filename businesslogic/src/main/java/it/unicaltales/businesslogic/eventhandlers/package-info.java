 * This package contains the business logic Event Handlers.
 * In the game we know what are the type of events that wee need.
 * We know that in the game wee need only for example three keys or only mouses 
 * or touch.

 * 
 * In this package there aren't not only hardware events. In fact there are sprite events and
 * a lot of useful event handler of any type .
