 * This package contains utils of drawer packgage.
 *
 * For example the principal (and for now the unique)
 * utility of this package is {@link it.unicaltales.businesslogic.drawer.utils.ImagesManager}
 * it is very useful, because in the Drawer implemented in each
 * different framework, if we won't to draw an image, we must
 * reallocate the image every time!
 * BUT with this class we have a map of images (the images are Object,
 * because it is indipendent by framework) in which we store all image
 * that we will draw!
